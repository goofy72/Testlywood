Title: “Cloud Error 404: Heaven Not Found”

INT. CLOUD - DAY

Our hero, IVAN (or pick any name you like), wakes up lying on a soft fluffy cloud. There’s harp music in the background — but it sounds like it’s played by an intern on their first day.

IVAN
(looks around, confused)
Okay… this is either heaven, or IKEA finally nailed comfort.

A glowing KIOSK appears in front of him, floating mid-air. The screen lights up with cheerful text.

KIOSK (cheerful voice)
🎉 Congratulations! End of life reached successfully! 🎉
Welcome to the Eternal Afterlife Self-Service Portal™.
Please select your religion to proceed.

IVAN
(reading aloud)
Select my… religion? Where’s the “I was just trying to help old ladies cross the road” button?

He squints. The options read:
“Christianity,” “Buddhism,” “Hinduism,” “Atheism,” “Star Wars (fan religion),” “Other (Not Supported).”

IVAN
Ah, perfect! None of the above.
(pauses)
Well, “Other (Not Supported)” sounds about right.

He taps it. The KIOSK immediately flashes a warning.

KIOSK
⚠️ Warning: Unsupported faith type detected. Please consult the manual.

Manual appears — 200 pages long. All in English.

IVAN
(reading the first line slowly)
“Welcome… to the Afterlife Operating System 2.5”?
Yeah, no. Skip.

He hits the SKIP button. A LOADING SCREEN appears: “Processing your soul… 87% complete.” Elevator music plays. The progress bar stops.

KIOSK
Error 666: Unexpected soul input. Assigning random afterlife experience.

IVAN
Wait, what—?

The cloud shakes. The screen changes to: “Congratulations! You’ve selected: Ancient Norse Afterlife!”

IVAN
Norse? Like… Vikings?

He looks down. His white robe instantly transforms into heavy fur armor. A giant battle axe appears in his hand.

IVAN
Oh great. I help grandmas cross the street, and now I’m supposed to fight ice giants.

KIOSK
Please proceed to Valhalla Gate B for eternal battle.
Note: Lunch is served at 12:00. Helmet rental available for 5 karma points.

IVAN
(shrugs)
Well… could’ve been worse. Could’ve been customer support.

He walks off into the mist as the KIOSK cheerfully restarts.

KIOSK
Next soul, please! And remember — read the terms and conditions!

FADE OUT. Harp music replaced by Viking drums.
